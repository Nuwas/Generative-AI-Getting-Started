1. <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b>

    Definition: AI is the broad field of creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence (e.g., reasoning, problem-solving, learning, and decision-making).
   
    Examples: Chatbots, recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube), self-driving cars.

2. <b>Machine Learning (ML) (Subset of AI)</b>

    Definition: ML enables computers to learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming.
   
    Types:
        Supervised Learning: Learns from labeled data (e.g., spam detection).
        Unsupervised Learning: Identifies patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).
        Reinforcement Learning: Learns by trial and error with rewards (e.g., AlphaGo, robotics).

3. <b>Deep Learning (DL) (Subset of ML)</b>

    Definition: Uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep networks) to recognize patterns in data.
   
    Why Important?: Powers complex AI tasks like image recognition (Face ID), speech recognition (Alexa, Siri), and autonomous driving.
   
    Examples:
        CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) ‚Üí Used in image processing.
        RNNs/LSTMs (Recurrent Neural Networks) ‚Üí Used in language modeling.

4. <b>Generative AI (Subset of DL)</b>

    Definition: AI that generates new content (text, images, audio, video) based on existing data.
   
    Examples:
        ChatGPT (text generation)
        DALL¬∑E, Midjourney (image generation)
        MusicLM (AI-generated music)
   
    Key Techniques:
        Transformers (LLMs) ‚Üí Used for text-based AI (e.g., GPT, BERT).
        GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) ‚Üí Used for deepfake images/videos.

    <b>In short</b>
    * AI is the big umbrella.
    * ML is a way for AI to learn.
    * DL is a more advanced ML method using neural networks.
    * Generative AI creates new content using DL.


<b>Core AI Constructs</b>

<b>LangChain</b> Its is a framework that helps developers build applications using Large Language Models (LLMs).
* It allows LLMs to connect with external data sources like databases, APIs, or even the internet.
* It also helps manage memory, retrieval, and reasoning, making AI responses more context-aware and intelligent.

<b>LangGraph</b> is an extension of LangChain that allows you to create complex workflows using LLMs.
* Instead of just a single question-answer flow, it lets you design multi-step conversations or decision-making processes.
* You can define if-else conditions, loops, and parallel tasks for more advanced AI applications.

<b>LLM</b> is a powerful AI model that understands and generates human-like text.
* These models are trained on huge datasets (billions of words).
* LLMs predict the next words based on context and patterns in language.
* Examples: GPT-4, Google Gemini, LLaMA, Claude.


<b>RAG</b> Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a method that improves AI-generated responses by adding real-world knowledge.
* Instead of just guessing from training data, RAG retrieves relevant facts from databases or documents.
* This makes LLMs more accurate and up-to-date.

How RAG works:

    a) User asks a question ‚Üí "What is the latest stock price of Tesla?"
    b) AI searches a database or Google
    c) Retrieves the latest stock price
    d) Combines the info with LLM-generated text
    e) Returns a complete, accurate answer

<b>Vector Databases</b> are optimized for storing and searching vector embeddings.
* It helps AI retrieve similar documents based on meaning, not just keywords.
* Examples: Pinecone, FAISS, ChromaDB, Weaviate, Milvus.
* It helps in RAG pipelines retrieving knowledge efficiently.

<b>Embedding</b> is a mathematical representation of words, phrases, or even images in vector space.
* Why it matters: Converts unstructured data (text, images, audio) into structured numbers that AI.
* AI converts text, images, and audio into vector embeddings (numerical representations).
* These embeddings are stored in vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS, ChromaDB, Weaviate).
* This allows AI to search for similar content efficiently.

Add missing points

<b>AI Agents</b> is a system that uses an LLM + tools to complete tasks autonomously.
* Instead of just answering questions, agents take actions (e.g, searching Google, running code, using APIs).
* Examples: OpenAI‚Äôs AutoGPT, BabyAGI, LangChain Agents.
Analogy: A chatbot answers questions, but an AI agent can act on them (like a digital assistant booking a flight).


<b>Prompt Engineering</b> is the process of designing effective inputs (prompts) for LLMs to get the best responses.
* A well-structured prompt improves accuracy & relevance.
* Examples:
    * Zero-shot prompting: Asking the model without examples.
    * Few-shot prompting: Providing examples to guide the model.
    * Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Asking the model to explain its reasoning step-by-step.
* Analogy: Teaching an AI is like training a dog üê∂‚Äîclear, structured commands work best!

<b>Multi-Modal AI (Text, Image, Audio, Video)</b> can process more than just text (e.g., images, speech, video).
* Expands AI beyond chatbots to real-world applications like image recognition, voice assistants, and video generation.
* Examples:
  * Text-to-Image: DALL¬∑E, MidJourney
  * Text-to-Speech (TTS): ElevenLabs, Google WaveNet
  * Speech-to-Text (STT): Whisper (OpenAI), Deepgram 
* Analogy: Think of Jarvis from Iron Man‚Äîhe understands text, voice, and images together.

<b>Fine-Tuning</b> is the process of training an LLM on custom data to specialize it.

<b>Prompt Engineering</b> is the process of optimizing inputs without modifying the model itself.

* Analogy: <b>Fine-tuning</b> is like teaching a dog new tricks, while <b>prompt engineering</b> is giving clearer commands.
